Create neon signs

Neon signs are bright and colorful electric signage that draws attention to something within an experience, such as where users can enter a building or purchase an item. By combining modeling and lighting techniques, you can create and use neon signs to elevate the immersion within your environments.

As with all 3D creation, there are many ways to achieve any particular goal. In this guide, you can quickly create your own neon sign using tools and methods available only within Studio with only a few basic assets, including a .obj file for the 3D text of the sign model.

A Part is Roblox's primary building block that you can move, resize, rotate, and customize to change their appearance, such as their color and material. Using basic parts to create the foundation of neon signs is useful because the signage's backboard and border only require basic shapes.
